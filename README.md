### Hello there 👋


With a Bachelor's degree in Control and Automation Engineering and more than 8 years of experience in analysis of computational algorithms. I always intend to seek personal and professional growth in addition to always stepping out of my comfort zone.

With ease in learning new knowledge and dealing with international teams, it allows me to adapt to different scenarios in collaboration with work teams, through methodologies to achieve the proposed results together.

From developments in embedded devices to complex data systems.

In my search for knowledge, today I develop international projects with companies from all over the world.
